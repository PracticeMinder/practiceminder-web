def ss(a, axis=0):
    """
    Squares each element of the input array, and returns the sum(s) of that.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : int or None, optional
        The axis along which to calculate. If None, use whole array.
        Default is 0, i.e. along the first axis.

    Returns
    -------
    ss : ndarray
        The sum along the given axis for (a**2).

    See also
    --------
    square_of_sums : The square(s) of the sum(s) (the opposite of `ss`).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> a = np.array([1., 2., 5.])
    >>> stats.ss(a)
    30.0

    And calculating along an axis:

    >>> b = np.array([[1., 2., 5.], [2., 5., 6.]])
    >>> stats.ss(b, axis=1)
    array([ 30., 65.])

def pearsonr(x, y):
    """
    Calculates a Pearson correlation coefficient and the p-value for testing
    non-correlation.

    The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship
    between two datasets. Strictly speaking, Pearson's correlation requires
    that each dataset be normally distributed. Like other correlation
    coefficients, this one varies between -1 and +1 with 0 implying no
    correlation. Correlations of -1 or +1 imply an exact linear
    relationship. Positive correlations imply that as x increases, so does
    y. Negative correlations imply that as x increases, y decreases.

    The p-value roughly indicates the probability of an uncorrelated system
    producing datasets that have a Pearson correlation at least as extreme
    as the one computed from these datasets. The p-values are not entirely
    reliable but are probably reasonable for datasets larger than 500 or so.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : (N,) array_like
        Input
    y : (N,) array_like
        Input

    Returns
    -------
    (Pearson's correlation coefficient,
     2-tailed p-value)
