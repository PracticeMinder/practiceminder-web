Practice Minder
===============

This Project is the result of an [NHS Hack Day](http://nhshackday.com/) held in 
Cambridge, UK on the second and third of November 2013.

A large amount of data about General practices in the UK is available publicly, both 
from the [Public Health Observatory](http://www.apho.org.uk/) and the 
[Health and Social Care Information Centre](http://www.hscic.gov.uk/) but efforts to 
make this data more accesible are less common than they could be.

Previous efforts have included [PrescribingAnalytics.com](http://prescribinganalytics.com/), 
also the result of an NHS Hack Day, and [openprescribing.org](http://www.openprescribing.org/), 
both dedicated to making sense of the prescription data with a particular focus on analysing 
geographical trends.

This project is aimed at making this data available in a way that is useful to 
educators, researchers and policy makers. In particular, we were interested in merging
publicly available information about drug prescriptions with individual practice data, and
instead of looking into geographical corellations, building a tool that lets user ask questions
rearging possible corellations between the available datasets.
